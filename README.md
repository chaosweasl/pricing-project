Ahoy! I've made this project as a way for me to practice my frontend skills :}

This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).
(Disclaimer regarding the project: I forgot to add the background images and also to change some active states, so it's not 100% complete but it's good enough, so I won't fix it :} )

This is the tech stack that I've used in this project:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
